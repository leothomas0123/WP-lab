<p>
The most recognisable scientist of our age, Hawking holds an iconic status. His genre-defining book, A Brief History of Time, 
has sold more than 10 million copies since its publication in 1988, and has been translated into more than 35 languages. 
His early life was the subject of an the film The Theory of Everything. 
He was routinely consulted for oracular  pronouncements on everything from time travel and alien life to Middle Eastern politics 
and nefarious robots. He had an endearing sense of humour and a daredevil attitude – relatable human traits that, combined with his 
seemingly superhuman mind, made Hawking eminently marketable.But his cultural status – amplified by his disability and the media 
storm it invoked – often overshadowed his scientific legacy. That’s a shame for the man who discovered what might prove to be the 
key clue to the theory of everything, advanced our understanding of space and time, helped shape the course of physics for the last 
four decades and whose insight continues to drive progress in fundamental physics today.

<h4>
1. Singularities – 1970
</h3>
<p>
Einstein's theory of gravity also tells about singularities i.e. points where space-time appeared to be infinitely curved. But that 
time it was unclear that whether singularities were real or not. Then, Roger Penrose proved that singularities would indeed form in 
black holes. Later, Stephen Hawking did path-breaking work on singularities and applied it for whole Universe and told that 
gravitation produces singularities. He also told that Einstein's theory predicted a singularity which was the big bang theory.
<h4>
2. Cosmic Inflation Theory – 1982
</h3>
<p>
This theory was introduced by Alan Guth in 1980 that in physical cosmology, cosmic inflation is a theory in which the Universe expands 
exponentially soon after the big bang. Further, Hawking was one of the first who calculate quantum fluctuations which means the small 
variations in the distribution of matter and shows that during inflation it might give rise to the spread of galaxies in the Universe.
